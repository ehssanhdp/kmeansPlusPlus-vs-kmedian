# kmeansPlusPlus-vs-kmedian
This repository implements and compares KMeans++ and KMedian clustering algorithms using various datasets (Aggregation, D31, R15, Iris, and Glass). The comparison evaluates performance in terms of computation time and purity. The code includes functions for initializing centroids, assigning clusters, and plotting results.
